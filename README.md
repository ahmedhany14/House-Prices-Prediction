## Description

This repository contains code and resources for predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. Predicting house prices is a classic problem in data science and machine learning, with applications in real estate, finance, and urban planning. By analyzing various features of a house, such as its size, location, and amenities, we aim to develop models that accurately predict its selling price.
